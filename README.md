# MHWilds Single Run Poster

This is meant to run on windows task scheuduler one time, scheduled at 7:01 pm to post the latest monster hunter event quest.

This was built using [NetCord](https://netcord.dev/), I highly advise taking a look at that site for some cool examples.  They dont show you EXACTLY where to place things to get them to work, but I do a pretty good job here with some simple examples.

## Disclaimer!!

This is a discord bot just built for fun and to create a helpful reminder for myself when the new updates come!! I want to just say that I do not claim any ownership of the images, the monster hunter name, or anything like that.  I also am a novice programmer and cant garuentee this wont accidentally just SPAM your discord.  So please use at your own risk.

## Description

This bot is a web scraper that parses the [official monster hunter wilds event quest site](https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/event-quest/en-us/schedule) and formats it into nice to read embed messages in discord.  It will download any images it needs to attach them properly.

#### Example: 

![Example Embed Message](/images/readmeexample1.png)

Right now its pretty specific to my discord group so you may need to tweak it a bit (using different channel IDs or role IDs etc etc)

## Getting it to work

I probably wont make this publically available as a bot (copyright and what not) but you are more than welcome to steal my code and take a peek at what you will need. I am excluding the appsettings.json, which if you read the tutorial on [NetCord](https://netcord.dev/), they will show you how to set it up.  I used vscode to run this (hence the .vscode folder) with the c# extension installed.  Then just run it like a console exe.  Happy Hunting!!!
